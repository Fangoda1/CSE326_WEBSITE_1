      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
        knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
        transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
        encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
        skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
        knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
        orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
        the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
        through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
        Kingdom.[6]


        Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
        Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[7] The city of
        Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
        of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
        civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[8]
